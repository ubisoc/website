				<h2>Postgraduates</h2>
				<p>
          Post Graduate students are a vital part of the Islamic Society community at
          the University of Birmingham. Weâ€™ve really jumped to the forefront in terms of
          Post Graduate Engagement over the last year with the introduction of our
          Post Graduate Officer role on our Committee and Post Graduate Specific Events.

      <p>
        We are looking to run even more events this year for Post Graduate including our very exciting Post Graduate Freshers Week events! Look out for them in the near future.
        If you have any ideas or questions, please contact our Post Graduate Officer:
        <strong>Sohail Hussain (<a href="mailto:sohail.hussain@ubisoc.co.uk">sohail.hussain@ubisoc.co.uk</a>)</strong>.

				<h3>Postgraduate Dinner</h3>
				<p>
					We held a free Post Graduate Dinner in November last year.
					It was an extremely successful social event where around 70 Post Graduates came,
					socialised, networked and generally enjoyed themselves in a fun and lively atmosphere.
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					"It was a great event. I think for the first time in Birmingham
					I found myself within the folks I belong. So definitely that was an
					event to remember and hope ISOC come up with other such events in future"

					I had a delightful time. We continued to get together occasionally with some
					brothers after this night."
