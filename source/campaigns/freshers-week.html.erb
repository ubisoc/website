				<h2>Freshers Week</h2>
				<p>
          Freshers Week is essentially Welcome Week at the University of Birmingham
          for new students. Students are introduced to the University with induction
          lectures and all Student Societies run a variety of events during Freshers Week
          to enable the new students to meet like minded people and make new friends.

        The Islamic Society organises an incredible itinerary of Freshers Week events every single year and this year is no different! We have a great list of events which you can see on the poster below.
        Itâ€™s a great opportunity to build new friendships and enjoy yourself in the fund and welcoming atmosphere the Islamic Society provides.

        We finish off Freshers Week with our annual Freshers Dinner where we serve a 3 course
        meal and host entertainment at a hall in Birmingham to allow new students to socialise
        and have fun with their newly found friends.
