                    From the main entrance, walk around until you get to the reception. Walk through the glass double doors next to the reception desk (as shown in the 1st image). When you walk through there are some stairs going down and to the side there is a little corridor leading to a lift entrance. This area is very rarely used, therefore you should be able to pray here without any issues. It is also out of the way. Use your coat or some other piece of clothing as a prayer mat if you do not have your own and pray facing in the direction show in the last image. For the nearest toilets, follow the signs or ask at reception. Toilets are located next to the café on the ground floor. This is a good area to use if you have lectures in gisbert kapp.
