				<h2>Assalamu alaykum! Welcome to the University of Birmingham Islamic Society!</h2>
				<p>
					The Islamic Society at the University of Birmingham is a vibrant, fast growing society which serves and represents Muslim students at the University of Birmingham.
				</p>

			<p>
				We organise <strong>Jumuah (Friday prayers)</strong>, <strong>campaigns</strong> (like our very successful annual Discover Islam Week) and <strong>over 100 different events</strong> over the course of the year!
				We have socials, Islamic talks, career development workshops and many more.
				We try and provide Muslims with an alternative to the regular University lifestyle by creating a fun, warm and welcoming atmosphere at all our events.
				We believe that belonging to a <strong>welcoming and active community</strong> is a vital aspect in enjoying University so we have done our utmost to make sure that you can come and join such a community.
